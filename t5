Introduction
After evaluating multiple serialization formats for our system, we have decided to adopt JSON Schema over Avro. This decision was made based on a thorough comparison of the two formats, considering factors such as system compatibility, ease of use, flexibility, and ecosystem support.

Key Benefits of JSON Schema
Flexibility and Compatibility JSON Schema offers greater flexibility in supporting various types of data structures, especially when working with dynamic or semi-structured data. It also integrates seamlessly with web-based applications and REST APIs, which are prevalent in our architecture. Avro, while efficient, is more rigid and better suited for systems where schemas are predefined and static.

Human-Readable Format JSON Schema is written in plain JSON, which is easier to read and understand for both developers and non-technical stakeholders. This improves the maintainability of our system, as team members across different roles can collaborate more effectively. In contrast, Avroâ€™s binary format is harder to interpret without specialized tools.

Widespread Adoption and Tooling JSON is widely used across modern tech stacks, and JSON Schema has strong community support. It is backed by a vast ecosystem of tools and libraries for validation, documentation, and integration. This makes it easier to adopt, troubleshoot, and scale. Avro has strong support as well, but its ecosystem is more niche and specialized.

Schema Evolution and Validation JSON Schema provides robust support for schema validation, allowing us to enforce rules at both the development and runtime levels. It also supports schema evolution, ensuring backward and forward compatibility as our data models evolve. While Avro also supports schema evolution, JSON Schema's integration with modern CI/CD pipelines is more streamlined for our needs.

Simplified Development Workflow Our system relies on a microservices architecture with frequent updates and multiple teams contributing. JSON Schema fits this agile development workflow better, as it allows quick validation of JSON documents against the schema without requiring serialization libraries, which are necessary for Avro.

Conclusion
Given the flexibility, ease of use, and compatibility of JSON Schema with our current and future system architecture, we believe it is the best choice for our serialization needs. Its advantages in human-readability, schema validation, and tooling support make it a more suitable fit than Avro for our use case.
